Branch homework:

keep fetched data in react context
fetch data in client
use Messages components as events notifications, also using context
Branch no-context:

does not use the react context
fetch data from API on server not client
use revalidatePath fn in API and use routers from next/navigation for refreshing cache
there are not Messages components, compare to branch homework (avoid using hooks)
there are CustomLink components instead next/links - cache avoid in client side
Branch prisma-code:

extend no-context branch with use prisma ORM for db connection
